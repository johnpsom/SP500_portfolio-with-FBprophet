# SP500_portfolio-with-FBprophet
A new attempt to create and test a more sound approach to investng in the SP500 stock universe.
This time in order to limit the number of stocks to use in our portfolio, i am going to use the fbprophet time series forecasting capability,
to see which of the stocks are, in the near future, goint to increase in price and use only from those to create a portfolio with the Pyportfopt. 
As usual the approach is going to be backtested.
